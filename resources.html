<div id="resources-text" class="text"><p><h3>Nathan Yau's bubble chart</h3>The visualisation I have chosen to make consists of a bubble chart. The bubble chart is an adapted version of Nathan Yau's bubble chart of <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2019/03/26/relationship-stages/">The Stages of a Relationship</a>.
The reason I chose to use this form of graph to represent the data, was because it allowed categorization by location in a smooth way and could be used to illustrate time passing at the same time.

    <h3>The national life tables</h3>
    The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/methodologies/nationallifetablesqmi">
        National Life Tables</a> contain data about mortality rates in England and Wales. By using the Kannisto-Thatcher
    methodology to quantify the number of years a person is statistically expected to have left, based on their age,
    gender and rates of mortality among this group. Of course a drawback of the resultant life expectancy is that it
    does not reflect the reality for those living with a disability. The tables have been used for future planning
    in a range of different industries, especially welfare.<br>
    <h3>The Office for National statistics - interactive</h3>
    The Office for National Statistics who published the tables, have used them to create <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/articles/whatismylifeexpectancyandhowmightitchange/2017-12-01">an interacting visualisation</a>
    which takes your age and gender as input and produces a graph showing the likelihood of a person with the specified
    characteristics reaching 100, while displaying the estimated life expectancy.
